# Contributing to TeslaBatteryBLE

Thanks for helping. This project is local-first, privacy-first, and AGPL-licensed;
contributions of all sizes are welcome — code, protocol notes, docs, design, and
bug reports.

## Development setup

1. **JDK 21** (Temurin recommended — CI uses it; JDK 17+ should work)
2. **Android SDK 35** (via Android Studio or `sdkmanager`)
3. Clone and build:

```bash
./gradlew :core:test                # protocol tests, no device required
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest    # app tests against the simulated car
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

On Windows use `.\gradlew`. Point `local.properties` at your SDK if Gradle cannot
find it (`sdk.dir=...`).

## Where things live

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `core/` | Pure-JVM protocol core (framing, session, pairing, VCSEC/Infotainment). **No Android dependencies** — keep it multiplatform-ready. |
| `app/` | Compose UI, BLE integration, foreground service, storage. |
| `app/src/debug/` | Simulated car for development and screenshots (no hardware needed). |
| `tools/go-fixtures/` | Fixture generator diffed against `teslamotors/vehicle-command` in CI. |
| `docs/` | Master plan, ADRs, protocol notes, research. |

## Test expectations

- Every protocol change ships with test vectors. Never hand-edit
  `tools/go-fixtures/expected.txt` — regenerate it from the Go implementation.
- New app logic should be covered by unit tests against the simulated car where
  possible; hardware-only paths should say so in the PR.
- CI must be green: `:core:test`, `:app:testDebugUnitTest`, `:app:lintDebug`,
  `:app:assembleDebug`, and the Go-fixture diff.

## Code style

- Kotlin official style, 4-space indent; match the surrounding code.
- Imperative commit subjects (`Add ...`, `Fix ...`, `Use ...`).
- New source files start with `SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only`.
- Never log VINs, private keys, session keys, or decrypted payloads.
- Keep refactors out of feature/fix changes.

## Pull requests

1. Fork / branch from `main`.
2. Make the change, add tests and docs (README/CHANGELOG/plan as applicable).
3. Sign off your commits with the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):
   `git commit -s` adds `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>`.
   We use DCO — **no CLA**.
4. Open the PR and fill in the template. Small, focused PRs merge fastest.

Hardware-dependent changes: note in the PR what was tested and what was not. Real-car
validation is batched by the maintainer (see the checklist in the master plan).
