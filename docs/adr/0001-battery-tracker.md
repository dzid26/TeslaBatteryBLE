# ADR-0001: Tesla BLE battery tracker

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-10-03

Android app (iOS later) that talks to a Tesla over BLE, starting with battery
SOC. No cloud. Kotlin + Compose with a Kotlin protocol core; no FFI.

## Protocol facts (verified against teslamotors/vehicle-command)

- GATT: service `00000211-b2d1-43f0-9b88-960cebf8b91e`, write `...0212...`,
  notify `...0213...`. `FEE7`/`7430000x` are not this protocol.
- Framing: 2-byte big-endian length, `MTU - 3` chunks, MTU 256.
- `UniversalMessage.RoutableMessage`, per-domain sessions: VCSEC (lock, closures;
  pollable while asleep) and Infotainment (charge state; requires awake car).
- Auth: P-256 ECDH session, AES-GCM (4-byte nonce on BLE) or HMAC-SHA256.
  Sessions persist; cache them or re-handshake.
- Advertised name: `S` + `sha1(vin)[0..8]` hex + `C`. Advertising stops when the
  car is at its maximum number of BLE connections.
- Pairing: unsigned `addKey`, NFC card tap on the console plus vehicle confirm.
  Roles: OWNER, DRIVER, CHARGING_MANAGER. Form factor ANDROID_DEVICE.

## Decisions

- Port the protocol to Kotlin from the Apache-2.0 Go implementation and the MIT
  Swift ports; reuse Tesla `.proto` files via Wire. The AGPL C++ libraries
  (pmdroid, yoziru/PedroKTFC lineage) are behavioral references only, never
  copied. Rejected: Go via gomobile (FFI, toolchain, key leaves Keystore),
  Capacitor/Flutter/RN (no protocol library), Python on device.
- Scanning: `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` + `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` + `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` on
  all API levels. Rejected the `neverForLocation` shortcut: the platform may
  filter scan results with it, and requesting location is the compatible
  behavior on every Android version, including 16.
- Default pairing role: CHARGING_MANAGER. Driver/owner only by explicit opt-in.
- Polling: VCSEC ~10s (safe while asleep); Infotainment charge state only while
  the car is awake, ~10s while charging. Never wake the car to read SOC.
- Key storage: software P-256 encrypted by a Keystore AES key; TEE-backed ECDH
  later.

## Milestones

1. DONE: scan by name pattern, connect, service discovery, MTU, GATT name.
2. Framing + session handshake, with JVM tests ported from Go vectors.
3. Pairing: unsigned addKey.
4. `BodyControllerState` + `GetState(Charge)` -> SOC on screen.
5. Foreground service, polling, encrypted session persistence.
6. Hardening, then the KMP/iOS decision.

## Risks

- Crypto edge cases: 4-byte nonce AES-GCM, SHA-1-truncated KDF, metadata hash,
  counters, clock sync. Pin the proto commit; use `tesla-control` as an oracle.
- Android OEM battery management kills background BLE; treat collection as
  best-effort, foreground service when needed.

## Correction (2026-10-07)

The "4-byte nonce" in Protocol facts and Risks is wrong (found in the docs audit,
#128). The BLE protocol uses standard 12-byte AES-GCM nonces: the Go
implementation takes the size from `gcm.NonceSize()`, and `TeslaCrypto.NONCE_SIZE`
is 12. The text above is left as written.
